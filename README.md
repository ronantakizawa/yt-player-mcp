# social-video-mcp

MCP server that gives AI agents the ability to play videos from YouTube and TikTok, browse your accounts, and control playback — all through a lightweight [mpv](https://mpv.io/) player window.

Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and any MCP-compatible client.

## Features

**Playback** — Play videos from YouTube or TikTok in a native mpv window with full remote control:
- Play, pause, stop, seek
- Playlist playback with next/prev navigation and shuffle
- Authenticated playback via Chrome cookies (age-restricted, private videos)

**YouTube Account** — Browse your YouTube account directly from your AI agent:
- Subscription feed, liked videos, watch later, history
- List subscribed channels
- Browse channel uploads and Shorts
- Search YouTube with personalized results

**TikTok** — Browse and play TikTok content:
- Fetch videos from any TikTok user profile
- Play a user's videos as a continuous playlist

**Video Info** — Fetch metadata without playing: title, description, chapters, duration, tags, view/like counts.

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew install mpv yt-dlp
```

- **mpv** — Lightweight video player
- **yt-dlp** — Video stream resolver and cookie extractor
- **Google Chrome** — Logged into YouTube/TikTok (for authenticated features)
- **Node.js** >= 18

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronantakizawa/social-video-mcp.git
cd social-video-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

Add to your Claude Code config (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "social-video": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/social-video-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Code.

## How It Works

- **Playback**: Spawns `mpv` with `--input-ipc-server` for JSON IPC control over a Unix socket. All playback commands (pause, seek, next/prev) are sent through this socket.
- **Data Fetching**: Calls `yt-dlp` directly with `-J --flat-playlist --cookies-from-browser chrome` to fetch structured JSON from video platforms.
- **Authentication**: Reads cookies from Chrome's local storage via yt-dlp's `--cookies-from-browser` flag. No OAuth setup required — if you're logged into a platform in Chrome, it just works.

## Platform Support
